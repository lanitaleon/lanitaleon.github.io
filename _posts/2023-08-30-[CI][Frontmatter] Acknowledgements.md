When the first copy of “Game Programming Patterns” sold, I guess I had the right to call myself an author. But it took time to feel comfortable with that label. Thank you to everyone who bought copies of my first book, and to the publishers and translators who brought it to other languages. You gave me the confidence to believe I could tackle a project of this scope. Well, that, and massively underestimating what I was getting myself into, but that’s on me.

当《Game Programming Patterns》第一版卖出时，我想我有资格称自己为作家。但是我需要时间来适应这个标签。感谢每一个购买我第一本书的人，感谢把它带到其他语言的出版商和译者。你给了我信心，让我相信我可以解决这种规模的项目。还有，大大低估了自己的处境，但那是我的错。

A fear particular to technical writing is getting stuff wrong. Tests and static analysis only get you so far. Once the code and prose is in ink on paper, there’s no fixing it. I am deeply grateful to the many people who filed issues and pull requests on the open source repo for the book. Special thanks go to cm1776, who filed 145 tactfully worded issues pointing out hundreds of code errors, typos, and unclear sentences. The book is more accurate and readable because of you all.

技术写作的一个特别的恐惧就是把东西弄错。测试和静态分析只能帮到这里。一旦代码和散文用墨水写在纸上，就无法修复了。我非常感谢许多人提出的问题和拉请求的开源回购的书。特别感谢 cm1776，他提交了145个巧妙措辞的问题，指出了数百个代码错误、打字错误和不清楚的句子。因为你们，这本书更准确，更易读。

I’m grateful to my copy editor Kari Somerton who braved a heap of computer science jargon and an unfamilar workflow in order to fix my many grammar errors and stylistic inconsistencies.

我很感激我的文字编辑 Kari Somerton，她冒着一大堆计算机科学术语和一个不熟悉的工作流程的风险来修复我的许多语法错误和文体上的不一致。

When the pandemic turned everyone’s life upside down, a number of people reached out to tell me that my book provided a helpful distraction. This book that I spent six years writing forms a chapter in my own life’s story and I’m grateful to the readers who contacted me and made that chapter more meaningful.

当这场大流行把每个人的生活都搅得天翻地覆时，许多人伸出手来告诉我，我的书提供了一个有益的分散注意力的方法。我花了六年时间写的这本书是我人生故事中的一个章节，我很感激那些联系我并使这一章更有意义的读者。

Finally, the deepest thanks go to my wife Megan and my daughters Lily and Gretchen. You patiently endured the time I had to sink into the book, and my stress while writing it. There’s no one I’d rather be stuck at home with.

最后，最深切的感谢我的妻子梅根和我的女儿莉莉和格雷琴。你耐心地忍受着我沉浸在书中的时间，忍受着我写书时的压力。我只想和你一起待在家里。
