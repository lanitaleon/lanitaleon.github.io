Spring Framework: The Origins of a Project and a Name

## Spring 框架：项目和名称的起源

I am regularly asked about the origin of the name "Spring."

经常有人问我 Spring 这个名字的由来。

The name goes back to late 2002. 

这个名字可以追溯到2002年末。

In November 2002, I published Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development. 

2002年11月，我发表了《 Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development 》。

The book was accompanied by 30,000 lines of framework code, which had accounted for a good deal of the year full-time I put into writing the book. 

这本书伴随着30,000行的框架代码，这些代码占据了我全年写这本书的大部分时间。

(Writing a 750 page book is enough work on its own; writing a substantial framework to go along with it is sheer masochism. It was hard.) 

(写一本750页的书的工作量本身就已经足够多; 同时再为它写一个实质性的庞大的框架是纯粹的受虐狂行为。这非常难。)

Many of the fundamental concepts of the Spring Framework were there: an already capable IoC container, with BeanFactory and ApplicationContext and sophisticated Dependency Injection (although that name was not coined until late 2003); an early form of what become Spring MVC with Controller, HandlerMapping and friends; the template concept; JdbcTemplate and the concept of technology-agnostic data access exception.

Spring 框架的许多基本概念已经存在: 
一个已经能够运行的 IoC 容器，包括 BeanFactory 和 ApplicationContext 以及复杂的依赖注入(尽管这个名字直到2003年底才被创造出来) ; 
一个早期形式的 Spring MVC，包括 Controller，HandlerMapping 和 friends; 
模板的概念; 
JdbcTemplate 和与技术无关的数据访问异常概念。

I wasn't sure what to do with the code. 

我不知道该怎么处理这些代码。

I was happy for people to use it if it benefited them, directly or as a guide to their own implementations. 

我很高兴人们使用它，如果它使他们受益，直接或作为他们自己的实现的指南。

I wasn't sure I wanted to commit time to an open source project (having already sacrificed almost a year's salary), but I was keen to see the concepts achieve the best possible implementation, and I couldn't do that alone. 

我不确定自己是否愿意为一个开源项目投入时间(我已经牺牲了将近一年的薪水) ，但我希望看到这些概念能够得到最好的实现，而我无法单独做到这一点。

Shortly after the book was published, readers began to use the Wrox forums to discuss the code and two of them Juergen Hoeller and Yann Caroff persuaded me to make the code the basis of an open source project, and became co-founders. 

在这本书出版后不久，读者们开始在 Wrox 的论坛上讨论代码，其中的两个人—— Juergen Hoeller 和 Yann caroff——说服我把代码作为一个开源项目的基础，并成为了联合创始人。

Juergen's name is of course central to any discussion of Spring today; but the Spring community should also remember Yann for his early contribution toward making the Spring project happen.

Juergen 的名字当然是今天任何关于 Spring 的讨论的中心; 但 Spring 社区也应该记住 Yann 对 Spring 项目的早期贡献。

Whatever happened next, the framework needed a name. 

无论接下来发生了什么，框架都需要一个名称。

In the book it was referred to as the "Interface21 framework" (at that point it used com.interface21 package names), but that was not a name to inspire a community. 

在书中，它被称为" Interface21框架 " (当时它使用了 com.interface21 包的名称) ，但这并不是一个能激发社区灵感的名称。

Fortunately Yann stepped up with a suggestion: "Spring". 

幸运的是，Yann提出了一个建议: "Spring"。

His reasoning was association with nature (having noticed that I'd trekked to Everest Base Camp in 2000); and the fact that Spring represented a fresh start after the "winter" of traditional J2EE. 

他的理由是与大自然的联系(注意到我曾在2000年长途跋涉到珠穆朗玛峰基地营#尼泊尔南基地营) ，而事实上，Spring 代表了传统 J2EE "winter" 之后的一个新的开始。

We recognized the simplicity and elegance of this name, and quickly agreed on it.

我们认识到这个名字的简单和优雅，很快就同意了。

Yann eventually stopped contributing to open source to concentrate on playing music as a hobby and having a normal social life. 

Yann 最终停止了对开源的贡献，转而把玩音乐作为一种业余爱好和正常的社交生活。

Juergen, of course, stepped up to make a decisive contribution to making Spring the force it is today. 

当然，Juergen 站了出来，为使 Spring 成为今天的样子做出了决定性的贡献。

Within a few months more the key Spring team had come together and the project went public in June 2003 and powered towards 1.0.

几个月后，关键的 Spring 团队聚集在一起，该项目于2003年6月上市，并朝着1.0迈进。
